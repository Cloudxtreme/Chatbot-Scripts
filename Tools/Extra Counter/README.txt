Count.txt in the script folder holds the current value,

Available commands (!rip is default and can be changed in the ui)
!rip            Show current count
!rip +          Increase count by 1
!rip -          Decrease count by 1
!rip #          Set count to a selected value
!rip reset      Resets the count to 0

# Chatbot Scripts
I'm by no means a professional programmer or even close to it, but I got a lot of dedication to the Streamlabs Chatbot and I love learning new things and expanding the features in it through custom python scripts.  If you need help setting up scripts I would recommend watching the video at the bottom of this page. Down below is a list of all scripts I've made and publicly released split into 2 categories, games and tools.
